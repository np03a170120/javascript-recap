# let & const

# let & const declaration are hoisted

# temporal deadzone: time between when the variable was hoisted with let & const untill a value is assigned. Throws reference error in temporal deadzone.

# variable defined with let & const is not attached to window object.

# let x; throws no error, const x throws error. const has to be both initialized and declared. (const x = 10)

# syntax error 
    let x = 10
    let x = 20

# reference error: javascript engine trying to access a specific variable which is not accessible
    clg(a);
    let a=100;

# recommended to use const whenever possible if not let (let has temporal deadzone). not to use var.

# initialization and declaration on the top of the code to avoid temporal deadzone.
