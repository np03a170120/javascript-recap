~Undefined

# let a = 3;
# variable a is set Undefined even when the line (let a = 3;) is not executed.
# Undefined is taking a memory space with variable "a"
# a placeholder value untill the variable is assigned a value.

# Undefined is not equal to empty

# javascript is a losely typed language meaning, it doesnt attach a variable to specific data-type, if a="one" can be a=12

# losely typed also means weakly typed
